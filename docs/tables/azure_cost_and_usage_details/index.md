# Table: azure_cost_and_usage_details - Query Azure Cost and Usage Details data

The `azure_cost_and_usage_details` table allows you to query data from Azure Cost and Usage Details exports. This table provides detailed information about Azure resource usage and costs, including subscription charges, resource consumption, pricing details, and billing information, enabling cost analysis, budget tracking, and optimization insights across Azure subscriptions.

## Configure

Create a [partition](https://tailpipe.io/docs/manage/partition) for `azure_cost_and_usage_details` ([examples](#example-configurations)):

```sh
vi ~/.tailpipe/config/azure.tpc
```

```hcl
connection "azure" "cost_account" {
  tenant_id       = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  subscription_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  client_id       = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  client_secret   = "my plaintext secret"
}
partition "azure_cost_and_usage_details" "my_costs" {
  source "azure_blob_storage" {
    connection   = connection.azure.cost_account
    account_name = "storage_account_name"
    container    = "container_name"
  }
}
```
